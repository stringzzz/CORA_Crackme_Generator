These are here to help you if you get stuck. 

I can only hope to encourage you to solve these crackmes on your own by just reverse engineering the executables, as that is the whole point of the learning process and challenge. 

As always, though, you can do whatever you want with it.

To note, I will often just be showing detailed end-of-line comments for the first time some code appears in one of the crackme executables. 
In later levels when that same code appears, I will most likely just put pre and post comments on there to give a brief summary of what it is doing. 
If needed, you may need to view the disassembly analysis of earlier levels to see the full details.

Also, important: Since CORA compiles the crackmes on your own machine, the disassembly for them will likely look very different than my example analysis.

Good luck! --stringzzz
